hw9:

1. make hw9.txt file

2. checkout version 3.0 of Diffutils 
git checkout v3.0
git checkout -b quote

3. patch this version 
patch -p1 <quote-3.0-patch.txt 

4. 5. learn how to use emacs 
I open each patched file and use C-x 4 a to add change log 

6. commit changes
git commit -F ChangeLog

7.make a patch
git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check

I ran this to make sure it works 
./src/diff . - : shows ./src/diff: cannot compare '-' to a directory

9.varify ChangeLog works 
make distdir
it creates a folder diffutils-3.0.1-7a06, and I looked into the ChangeLog in the folder and it has my newest commit in it

10. git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs
I reopen the server with ssh -X command so that we can have graphic display
and use gitk to see the window
